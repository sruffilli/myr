Myr is a Telegram bot piggybacking the Google Translate APIs to translate in a group chat back and forth from Italian to Ukranian, born in April 2022 out of necessity.

You know what to do - just make sure the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable is set to your Telegram Bot token.

Build with `docker build -t myr`
